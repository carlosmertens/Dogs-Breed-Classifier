# Image Classification for a City Dog Show

A city is hosting a citywide dog show. Every participant that registers must
submit an image of their dog along with biographical information
about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the
biographical information. We need to create a Python classifier to
make sure the participants are dogs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Machine Learning Library

```
TorchVision
```

### Installing

PyTorch's website

```
https://pytorch.org
```

## Running the tests

```
python check_images.py
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Pet_images folder contains 40 images of dogs and not dogs. Program runs through
them and check if they are dogs.
